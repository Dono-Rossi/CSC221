1. CPUs are built on transistors which are essentially very small switches. 
   *  These switches are represented as either on or off, and make up your 
entire computer
   *   Binary numbers are used to represent these switches, 1 for on and 0 for
off
   *  Python is a high level language that allows it to manipulate binaru but 
many user friendly features make that hard to do
   *  Bitwise operations are used to combine or change binary numbers
        *   z = x AND y where bits in z are on only if corresponding bits in X  and Y are on
        *   z = x OR y where bits in z are on if corresponding bits in either x or y are on
        *   Z = x XOR (exclusive or) y where bits in z are on if corresponding bits in only one of x or y are on
        *   z = NOT x where bits in z are opposite of corresponding bits in x
        *   z = x << n where bits in z are shifted left by n postitions
        *   z = x >> n where bits in z are shifted right by n positions

Bitwise operators allow you to:

   * Create and manipulate flags
   * Access a portion of a number
   * Manipulate raw binary data
